Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/Ligux, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the Ligux trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/geno/ligux.git -b ics

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
